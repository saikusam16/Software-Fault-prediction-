Software fault prediction aims to identify fault-prone software modules by using some underlying properties of the software project before the actual testing process begins. It helps in obtaining desired software quality with optimized cost and effort. Initially, this paper provides an overview of the software fault prediction process. Next, different dimensions of the software fault prediction process are explored and discussed. This review aims to help with the understanding of various elements associated with the fault prediction process and to explore various issues involved in the software fault prediction. Ensemble learning combines a series of base classifiers and the final result is assigned to the corresponding class by using a majority voting mechanism. However, the base classifiers in the ensemble cannot perform equally well. Therefore, the base classifiers should be assigned different weights in order to increase classification performance. In this study, a novel Weighted Majority Voting Ensemble (WMVE) approach is proposed, which evaluates individual performances of each classifier in the ensemble and adjusts their contributions to class decision. In the proposed weight adjustment model, only a reward mechanism is provided, so punishment is not included. Classifiers that correctly classify observations which are not correctly classified by most of the classifiers gain more weights in the ensemble.
